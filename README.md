## Running the Generated Application

The generated application is a Maven project based mostly on the [HAPI-FHIR Starter Project](https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter).  To run the application, navigate to the generated directory and run the following command:

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```


mvnDebug spring-boot:run

Need to run in wsl terminal as windows has a file length issue
