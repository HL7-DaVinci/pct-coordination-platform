## Foundry
A live demo is hosted by [HL7 FHIR Foundry](https://foundry.hl7.org/products/f2f338e7-883b-4836-b3bb-df9cd3f4d949).

## Running the Generated Application

The generated application is a Maven project based mostly on the [HAPI-FHIR Starter Project](https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter).  To run the application, navigate to the generated directory and run the following command:

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```


mvnDebug spring-boot:run

Need to run in wsl terminal as windows has a file length issue


Running in Docker

```
docker compose up
```
